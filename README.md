# Github-mass-lockout

##When your security vulnerabilities become features.
##Just tired of their "dedicated team to prevent abuse issues" and later seeing that the vulnerability was fixed.
##Also, I know that they will never disclose this, like they didn't before.
##So, good luck github. Hope that your team prevents a mass-account-lockout
